1. EDA to identify and exclude: 
   1.1. Multivariate outlier rows. 
   1.2. Features with different patterns among train and test set.     

2. Dimensional reduction using PLS Regression.     

3. Deep Learning modeling full based on "MoA | Pytorch | 0.01859 | RankGauss | PCA | NN" developed by Kushal Agrawal ( @kushal1506 ) ( https://www.kaggle.com/kushal1506 )
